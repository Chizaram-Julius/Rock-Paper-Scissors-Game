**Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

A web-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates core front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic implementation.

**Overview**

The application allows a user to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against a computer opponent.
Each round processes user input, generates a randomized computer choice, determines the outcome, and updates the score dynamically.

**Key Features**

- User-friendly interface with emoji-based controls

- Randomized computer decision logic

- Real-time result feedback (Win, Lose, Tie)

- Persistent score tracking during gameplay

- Clean, responsive layout with visual state indicators

**Technologies Used**

HTML5 – Semantic markup and structure

CSS3 – Styling, layout, and hover interactions

JavaScript (ES6) – Game logic, DOM manipulation, and state management

**Application Flow**

- The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors

- The computer generates a random selection

- The game logic compares both choices

- The result is displayed and the score is updated accordingly
